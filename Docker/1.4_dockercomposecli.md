eğersadece container lar silinme isteniyorsa  diğer componentler silinmesin iteniyorsa _docker-compose rm_ komutu kullanılmalı


3. docker-compose events

Usage: events [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --json      Output events as a stream of json objects


With the --json flag, a json object is printed one per line with the format:

```
{
    "time": "2015-11-20T18:01:03.615550",
    "type": "container",
    "action": "create",
    "id": "213cf7...5fc39a",
    "service": "web",
    "attributes": {
        "name": "application_web_1",
        "image": "alpine:edge"
    }
}

```


4. docker-compose exec

This is the equivalent of docker exec. With this subcommand you can run arbitrary commands in your services. Commands are by default allocating a TTY, so you can use a command such as docker-compose exec web sh to get an interactive prompt.


Usage: exec [options] [-e KEY=VAL...] SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]

```
Options:
    -d, --detach      Detached mode: Run command in the background.
    --privileged      Give extended privileges to the process.
    -u, --user USER   Run the command as this user.
    -T                Disable pseudo-tty allocation. By default `docker-compose exec`
                      allocates a TTY.
    --index=index     index of the container if there are multiple
                      instances of a service [default: 1]
    -e, --env KEY=VAL Set environment variables (can be used multiple times,
                      not supported in API < 1.25)
    -w, --workdir DIR Path to workdir directory for this command.
```

5. docker-compose ps

``` shell
$ docker-compose ps
         Name                        Command                 State             Ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mywordpress_db_1          docker-entrypoint.sh mysqld      Up (healthy)  3306/tcp
mywordpress_wordpress_1   /entrypoint.sh apache2-for ...   Restarting    0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp
```

6. docker-compose pull

Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml or docker-stack.yml file, but does not start containers based on those images.

```
Usage: pull [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --ignore-pull-failures  Pull what it can and ignores images with pull failures.
    --parallel              Deprecated, pull multiple images in parallel (enabled by default).
    --no-parallel           Disable parallel pulling.
    -q, --quiet             Pull without printing progress information
    --include-deps          Also pull services declared as dependencies
```

7. docker-compose push

Pushes images for services to their respective registry/repository.

The following assumptions are made:

- You are pushing an image you have built locally
- You have access to the build key

```
version: '3'
services:
  service1:
    build: .
    image: localhost:5000/yourimage  # goes to local registry

  service2:
    build: .
    image: youruser/yourimage  # goes to youruser DockerHub registry
```

8. docker-compose rm

docker-compose down komutundan farklı olarak volume, netvork vb componentler isilmez.

9. docker-compose run

```

Usage:
    run [options] [-v VOLUME...] [-p PORT...] [-e KEY=VAL...] [-l KEY=VALUE...]
        SERVICE [COMMAND] [ARGS...]

Options:
    -d, --detach          Detached mode: Run container in the background, print
                          new container name.
    --name NAME           Assign a name to the container
    --entrypoint CMD      Override the entrypoint of the image.
    -e KEY=VAL            Set an environment variable (can be used multiple times)
    -l, --label KEY=VAL   Add or override a label (can be used multiple times)
    -u, --user=""         Run as specified username or uid
    --no-deps             Don't start linked services.
    --rm                  Remove container after run. Ignored in detached mode.
    -p, --publish=[]      Publish a container's port(s) to the host
    --service-ports       Run command with the service's ports enabled and mapped
                          to the host.
    --use-aliases         Use the service's network aliases in the network(s) the
                          container connects to.
    -v, --volume=[]       Bind mount a volume (default [])
    -T                    Disable pseudo-tty allocation. By default `docker-compose run`
                          allocates a TTY.
    -w, --workdir=""      Working directory inside the container


```


Runs a one-time command against a service. For example, the following command starts the web service and runs bash as its command.
```
docker-compose run web bash
```
Commands you use with run start in new containers with configuration defined by that of the service, including volumes, links, and other details. However, there are two important differences.

First, the command passed by run overrides the command defined in the service configuration. For example, if the web service configuration is started with bash, then docker-compose run web python app.py overrides it with python app.py.

Alternatively, manual port mapping can be specified with the --publish or -p options, just as when using docker run:
```
docker-compose run --publish 8080:80 -p 2022:22 -p 127.0.0.1:2021:21 web python manage.py shell
```

10. docker-compose stop

Stops running containers without removing them. They can be started again with docker-compose start.

```
Usage: stop [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
  -t, --timeout TIMEOUT      Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds.
                             (default: 10)
```

11. docker-compose start


Stops running containers without removing them. They can be started again with docker-compose start.


12. docker-compose top

Displays the running processes.

```
$ docker-compose top
compose_service_a_1
PID    USER   TIME   COMMAND
----------------------------
4060   root   0:00   top

compose_service_b_1
PID    USER   TIME   COMMAND
----------------------------
4115   root   0:00   top
```

13. docker-compose up

```
Usage: up [options] [--scale SERVICE=NUM...] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    -d, --detach               Detached mode: Run containers in the background,
                               print new container names. Incompatible with

                               them. Incompatible with --force-recreate and -V.
    --no-build                 Don't build an image, even if it's missing.
    --no-start                 Don't start the services after creating them.
    --build                    Build images before starting containers.
    --abort-on-container-exit  Stops all containers if any container was
                               stopped. Incompatible with -d.
    -t, --timeout TIMEOUT      Use this timeout in seconds for container
                               shutdown when attached or when containers are

                               container. Implies --abort-on-container-exit.
    --scale SERVICE=NUM        Scale SERVICE to NUM instances. Overrides the
                               `scale` setting in the Compose file if present.
```


Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.

Unless they are already running, this command also starts any linked services.

The docker-compose up command aggregates the output of each container (essentially running docker-compose logs -f). When the command exits, all containers are stopped. Running docker-compose up -d starts the containers in the background and leaves them running.

If there are existing containers for a service, and the service’s configuration or image was changed after the container’s creation, docker-compose up picks up the changes by stopping and recreating the containers (preserving mounted volumes). To prevent Compose from picking up changes, use the --no-recreate flag.

If you want to force Compose to stop and recreate all containers, use the --force-recreate flag.

If the process encounters an error, the exit code for this command is 1.

If the process is interrupted using SIGINT (ctrl + C) or SIGTERM, the containers are stopped, and the exit code is 0.

If SIGINT or SIGTERM is sent again during this shutdown phase, the running containers are killed, and the exit code is 2.
